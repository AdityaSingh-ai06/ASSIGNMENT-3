# Python Practice Programs



##### This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and the use of Python's built-in modules.

#### 

#### ***TASK 1: Factorial Calculator (factorial\_calculator.py)***



###### This program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

###### 

###### Functionality:

###### 

* ###### Defines a function factorial(n) that computes the factorial of n.
* ###### It can handle the base case where the factorial of 0 is 1.
* ###### The program includes a sample call to the function to demonstrate its usage.
* ###### An example output for the input 5 would be 120.

#### ***TASK 2: Math Module Calculator (math\_module\_calculator.py)***



###### This program demonstrates the use of Python's built-in math module to perform common mathematical calculations.

###### 

###### Functionality:

###### 

* ###### Prompts the user to enter a number.
* ###### Uses the math module to calculate:
* ###### The square root (math.sqrt())
* ###### The natural logarithm (math.log())
* ###### The sine in radians (math.sin())
* ###### Displays the results of these calculations to the user.
* ###### Feel free to explore the code to understand the implementation details.
